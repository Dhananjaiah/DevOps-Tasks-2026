# 📚 Navigation Guide: Real-World Prometheus Tasks

## Quick Overview

The real-world tasks for Part 10 (Prometheus) are organized in **two separate files** for optimal learning:

### 📝 [REAL-WORLD-TASKS.md](./REAL-WORLD-TASKS.md)
**Contains:** Task questions, requirements, and validation checklists  
**Use this when:** You want to attempt a task on your own

### ✅ [REAL-WORLD-TASKS-SOLUTIONS.md](./REAL-WORLD-TASKS-SOLUTIONS.md)
**Contains:** Complete step-by-step solutions with configurations and PromQL queries  
**Use this when:** You need to verify your solution or get unblocked

---

## Why Two Files?

### Learning Benefits
- **Encourages self-learning**: Try the task before seeing the solution
- **Prevents accidental spoilers**: Solutions are in a separate file
- **Easy comparison**: Compare your approach with the official solution
- **Better organization**: Clear separation of questions and answers

### Navigation Features
Both files include:
- ✅ Links to navigate between tasks and solutions
- ✅ Quick reference tables with all tasks
- ✅ Direct links to specific sections
- ✅ Breadcrumb navigation at the top

---

## How to Use These Files

### Recommended Workflow

#### Step 1: Open the Tasks File
Start with [REAL-WORLD-TASKS.md](./REAL-WORLD-TASKS.md)

#### Step 2: Choose a Task
Use the **Task Index** table to select a task based on:
- Your skill level
- Time available
- Topic of interest

#### Step 3: Attempt the Task
- Read the scenario carefully
- Note the time limit
- Follow the requirements
- Try to implement on your own

#### Step 4: Check Your Solution
When ready, open [REAL-WORLD-TASKS-SOLUTIONS.md](./REAL-WORLD-TASKS-SOLUTIONS.md)
- Navigate to the same task number
- Compare your approach
- Learn from the differences
- Understand best practices

#### Step 5: Iterate and Improve
- Refine your solution based on what you learned
- Try variations and edge cases
- Move to the next task

## File Navigation Tips

### Using GitHub's Navigation
- Use the **Table of Contents** icon (top-left in file view) to see all headings
- Click any heading to jump directly to that section
- Use browser's Find (Ctrl+F / Cmd+F) to search for specific terms

### Cross-Reference Links
- Each task in REAL-WORLD-TASKS.md links to its solution
- Each solution links back to the task description
- Use these links to quickly navigate between files

### Breadcrumb Navigation
Look for navigation links at the top of each file:
```
📖 [Main README](../README.md) | [Tasks](./REAL-WORLD-TASKS.md) | [Solutions](./REAL-WORLD-TASKS-SOLUTIONS.md)
```
