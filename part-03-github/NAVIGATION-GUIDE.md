# 📚 Navigation Guide: Real-World GitHub Tasks

## Quick Overview

The real-world tasks for Part 3 (GitHub) are organized in **two separate files** for optimal learning:

### 📝 [REAL-WORLD-TASKS.md](./REAL-WORLD-TASKS.md)
**Contains:** Task questions, requirements, and validation checklists  
**Use this when:** You want to attempt a task on your own

### ✅ [REAL-WORLD-TASKS-SOLUTIONS.md](./REAL-WORLD-TASKS-SOLUTIONS.md)
**Contains:** Complete step-by-step solutions with scripts and configurations  
**Use this when:** You need to verify your solution or get unblocked

---

## Why Two Files?

### Learning Benefits
- **Encourages self-learning**: Try the task before seeing the solution
- **Prevents accidental spoilers**: Solutions are in a separate file
- **Easy comparison**: Compare your approach with the official solution
- **Better organization**: Clear separation of questions and answers

### Navigation Features
Both files include:
- ✅ Links to navigate between tasks and solutions
- ✅ Quick reference tables with all tasks
- ✅ Direct links to specific sections
- ✅ Breadcrumb navigation at the top

---

## How to Use These Files

### Recommended Workflow

#### Step 1: Open the Tasks File
Start with [REAL-WORLD-TASKS.md](./REAL-WORLD-TASKS.md)

#### Step 2: Choose a Task
Use the **Task Index** table to select a task based on:
- Your skill level
- Time available
- Topic of interest

#### Step 3: Attempt the Task
- Read the scenario carefully
- Note the time limit
- Follow the requirements
- Complete the validation checklist

#### Step 4: When You Need Help
Click the **"View Complete Solution"** link at the top of any task to jump directly to its solution

#### Step 5: Compare Your Solution
After completing the task:
1. Open the solution file
2. Compare your approach
3. Learn from differences
4. Note any best practices you missed

## Navigation Tips

### From Tasks to Solutions
Every task has a solution link in two places:
1. **Task Index table** - Quick access from the index
2. **Task header** - Direct link at the start of each task

Example:
```
## Task 3.1: Implement GitFlow Branching Strategy

> 📖 [View Complete Solution](./REAL-WORLD-TASKS-SOLUTIONS.md#task-31-implement-gitflow-branching-strategy)
```

### From Solutions to Tasks
Every solution has a back link:
```
## Task 3.1: Implement GitFlow Branching Strategy

> 📋 [Back to Task Description](./REAL-WORLD-TASKS.md#task-31-implement-gitflow-branching-strategy)
```

### Keep Both Files Open
**Pro Tip:** Open both files in separate browser tabs or editor panes for easy switching!
