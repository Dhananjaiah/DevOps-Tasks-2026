### Template Solutions (18/20)

Tasks 7.3-7.20 currently have solution templates that include:
- Prerequisites section
- Implementation outline
- Basic YAML structure
- Verification steps outline
- Best practices list
- Troubleshooting framework
- Interview question placeholders

These provide the structure and can be expanded with full implementations.

## Solution Pattern Established

The first two tasks demonstrate the comprehensive solution pattern:

1. **Prerequisites** - Tools and access needed
2. **Step-by-Step Implementation** - Detailed instructions
3. **Complete YAML Manifests** - Production-ready configurations
4. **Configuration Files** - All necessary configs
5. **Verification Steps** - How to validate the solution
6. **Best Practices** - Industry standards implemented
7. **Troubleshooting Guide** - Common issues and solutions
8. **Interview Questions** - 5+ questions with detailed answers

## Next Steps

To complete remaining solutions (Tasks 7.3-7.20):

1. Follow the pattern established in Tasks 7.1 and 7.2
2. Provide complete YAML manifests for each task
3. Add detailed step-by-step instructions
4. Include verification procedures
5. Add troubleshooting scenarios
6. Create interview questions with answers

## What's Available Now

### Complete and Ready for Use
- ✅ All 20 task descriptions with scenarios (REAL-WORLD-TASKS.md)
- ✅ Navigation and quick start guides
- ✅ 2 fully detailed solution examples
- ✅ Solution templates for remaining 18 tasks
